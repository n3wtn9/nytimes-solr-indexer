Solr Indexer for The New York Times Annotated Corpus
---
This script will index the New York Times Corpus NITF xml news data provided by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).
It also contains an example solr config files to help you get started.

To use the solr schemas, copy schema.xml and solrconfig.xml to your solr/config folder.
Then, start up your solr instance.

To run the indexer script:
1. install jruby from http://jruby.org/ 
2. install rsolr ruby gem: jgem install rsolr 
3. Copy times timestools.jar from the "nytimes data/build/timestools.jar" directory
4. jruby nytimes_solr_indexer.rb "path/to/nytimes data/data"

NOTES:
This script could be sped up by changing the RSolr.connect method to use the rsolr-direct gem

I use the traditional server post for flexibility in case the solr server is running on a remote server.
